      " among bacteria and archaea, amino acid usage is correlated with habitat temperatures. in particular, protein surfaces in species thriving at higher temperatures appear to be enriched in amino acids that stabilize protein structure and depleted in amino acids that decrease thermostability. does this observation reflect a causal relationship, or could the apparent trend be caused by phylogenetic relatedness among sampled organisms living at different temperatures? and do proteins from endothermic...\n",

      "In the present study, we show that gc is a major determinant of the evolution and survival of vertebrate genomes. We also show that a high-gc gc density is associated with a high rate of evolution in the vertebrate genome. We show that high-gc gc densities are associated with an increase in the rate of evolutionary change in the human genome, and that this increase is accompanied by a decrease in the number of genes that are involved in the development of the human organism. We conclude that the high-Gc density hypothesis is a plausible explanation for the high rates of evolution observed in human genomes.\n",

      "In the present study, we show that gc is a major determinant of the evolution and survival of vertebrate genomes. We also show that a high-gc gc density is associated with a high rate of evolution in the vertebrate genome. We show that high-gc gc densities are associated with an increase in the rate of evolutionary change in the human genome, and that this increase is accompanied by a decrease in the number of genes that are involved in the development of the human organism. We conclude that the high-Gc density hypothesis is a plausible explanation for the high rates of evolution observed in human genomes.\n",

      "In this paper, we present the results of a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of a wide range of pathogenic organisms. The phylogenetic analyses are based on the assumption that all organisms are closely related to one another, and that the phylogenetic relationships between the organisms are well-defined. In addition, we show that the evolutionary relationships between pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms are very similar, with the exception of a few organisms that are not related to each other at all. We also show that there is a strong correlation between the number of genes in each organism and the degree of similarity between the organism and its host.\n",

We also found that the gene expression profile of yeast is similar to that of humans and mice, and that the differences in expression between species are not due to a single gene, but rather to a number of factors.\n",

The genetic vulnerability of rapeseed has been shown to be related to a wide range of phenotypes, including phenotypes that are associated with genetic vulnerability, such as phenotypes associated with susceptibility to certain diseases, and phenotypes related to susceptibility to other phenotypes. We also show that genetic vulnerability can be associated with traits that are not associated with vulnerability to other traits. In addition, we demonstrate that genetic susceptibility can be linked to traits that have been associated with phenotypes in other populations.\n",
