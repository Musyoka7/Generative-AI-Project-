      " among bacteria and archaea, amino acid usage is correlated with habitat temperatures. in particular, protein surfaces in species thriving at higher temperatures appear to be enriched in amino acids that stabilize protein structure and depleted in amino acids that decrease thermostability. does this observation reflect a causal relationship, or could the apparent trend be caused by phylogenetic relatedness among sampled organisms living at different temperatures? and do proteins from endothermic...\n",

      "In the present study, we show that gc is a major determinant of the evolution and survival of vertebrate genomes. We also show that a high-gc gc density is associated with a high rate of evolution in the vertebrate genome. We show that high-gc gc densities are associated with an increase in the rate of evolutionary change in the human genome, and that this increase is accompanied by a decrease in the number of genes that are involved in the development of the human organism. We conclude that the high-Gc density hypothesis is a plausible explanation for the high rates of evolution observed in human genomes.\n",

We show that a high-gc gc density is associated with a high rate of evolution in the vertebrate genome, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the high-gc density is a result of selection on gc.\n",
